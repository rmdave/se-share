    <p>
        Yep, we want to show case the mashup capability of the Apigee Edge Platform

                Bing

            <td>
                Take an lat/long and search within 5 kilometres of that address for a hospital (or some other entity).
                You will need a Bing Map Key - http://www.microsoft.com/maps/create-a-bing-maps-key.aspx.
                I created a Basic key for the demo.

                We assume that a browser made the invocation.  We use this service to do a IP to Geo lookup and get the lat/long.
                You will need an account for IP Info DB - http://www.ipinfodb.com/

    <div id='demoOverview'>
        <p>Here is what this demo will do:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Allow user to submit a <a href='./processBingResponse/bingResponse.html'>form with a radius</a></li>
            <li>Lookup their lat/long by calling an IP to Geo service</li>
            <li>Start an async call to get weather from OpenWeatherMap</li>
            <li>Call Bing Maps to get banks within the radius specified</li>
            <li>Mashup the Weather and Points of Interest data and return to caller</li>
            <li>Future considerations covered in another demo - mobile optimization for this user</li>
